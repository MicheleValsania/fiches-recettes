# ChefSide Trademark Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2026-02-18

This policy explains how the name and brand assets for `ChefSide` may be used.
It is separate from the Apache-2.0 software license.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to:
- the name `ChefSide`
- project logos, icons, and wordmarks
- related branding elements used to identify the official project

## 2. What Apache-2.0 allows

The Apache-2.0 license allows broad use of the source code, including commercial use.
It does **not** grant rights to use project trademarks in a way that implies affiliation,
endorsement, certification, or official status.

## 3. Allowed uses without prior approval

You may, without asking permission:
- make truthful statements such as "based on ChefSide" or "forked from ChefSide"
- link to the official repository and documentation
- refer to `ChefSide` in comparative or descriptive contexts
- keep existing attribution and NOTICE content required by license

## 4. Uses that require permission

You must obtain prior written permission for:
- using `ChefSide` in a product, company, or service name
- using ChefSide logos/wordmarks in app icons, splash screens, storefront listings, or ads
- claiming or implying the software is an official ChefSide build
- using branding that is likely to confuse users about origin or endorsement

## 5. Forks and redistributions

If you distribute a modified or forked version:
- rename it clearly to avoid confusion with official ChefSide releases
- remove or replace official ChefSide logos and brand visuals unless authorized
- keep license and attribution notices required by Apache-2.0
- clearly disclose that your version is unofficial

## 6. Fair use and nominative use

Reasonable factual references to `ChefSide` are permitted (for example in documentation,
tutorials, issue reports, and compatibility statements), provided the use is accurate
and not misleading.

## 7. Reservation of rights

All trademark rights in `ChefSide` branding are reserved by Michele Valsania.
This policy may be updated over time. Continued use of the marks must follow
the latest published version.

## 8. Contact

For trademark permission requests, include:
- who you are
- how and where the mark will appear
- screenshots/mockups
- distribution channels and geography
